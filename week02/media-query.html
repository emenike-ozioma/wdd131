            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that our Savior - who is Christ, the Son of God - 
                the Rock on which you build your foundation ; that when the devil shall send forth his
                mighty winds, yea, his lightnings in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm
                shall shake you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down into the abyss of misery and 
                endless woe, because of the Rock upon which you are built, which is a sure foundation, and when
                men build upon this foundation they cannot fall.</p>

                men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
